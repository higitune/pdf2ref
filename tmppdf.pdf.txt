ABSTRACT
On many social networking web sites such as Facebook and Twitter, resharing or reposting functionality allows users to share others’ content with their own friends or followers. As content is
reshared from user to user, large cascades of reshares can form.
While a growing body of research has focused on analyzing and
characterizing such cascades, a recent, parallel line of work has
argued that the future trajectory of a cascade may be inherently unpredictable. In this work, we develop a framework for addressing
cascade prediction problems. On a large sample of photo reshare
cascades on Facebook, we ﬁnd strong performance in predicting
whether a cascade will continue to grow in the future. We ﬁnd that
the relative growth of a cascade becomes more predictable as we
observe more of its reshares, that temporal and structural features
are key predictors of cascade size, and that initially, breadth, rather
than depth in a cascade is a better indicator of larger cascades. This
prediction performance is robust in the sense that multiple distinct
classes of features all achieve similar performance. We also discover that temporal features are predictive of a cascade’s eventual
shape. Observing independent cascades of the same content, we
ﬁnd that while these cascades differ greatly in size, we are still able
to predict which ends up the largest.

INTRODUCTION

The sharing of content through social networks has become an
important mechanism by which people discover and consume information online. In certain instances, a photo, link, or other piece
of information may get reshared multiple times: a user shares the
content with her set of friends, several of these friends share it with
their respective sets of friends, and a cascade of resharing can develop, potentially reaching a large number of people. Such cascades have been identiﬁed in settings including blogging [1, 13,
21], e-mail [12, 22], product recommendation [20], and social sites
such as Facebook and Twitter [9, 18]. A growing body of research

.

has focused on characterizing cascades in these domains, including
their structural properties and their content.
In parallel to these investigations, there has been a recent line
of work adding notes of caution to the study of cascades. These
cautionary notes fall into two main genres: ﬁrst, that large cascades
are rare [11]; and second, that the eventual scope of a cascade may
be an inherently unpredictable property [28, 31]. The ﬁrst concern
— that large cascades are rare — is a widespread property that has
been observed quantitatively in many systems where information
is shared. The second concern is arguably more striking, but also
much harder to verify quantitatively: to what extent is the future
trajectory of a cascade predictable; and which features, if any, are
most useful for this prediction task?
Part of the challenge in approaching this prediction question is
that the most direct ways of formulating it do not fully address the
two concerns above. Speciﬁcally, if we are presented with a short
initial portion of a cascade and asked to estimate its ﬁnal size, then
we are faced with a pathological prediction task, since almost all
cascades are small. Alternately, if we radically overrepresent large
cascades in our sample, we end up studying an artiﬁcial setting
that does not resemble how cascades are encountered in practice.
A set of recent initial studies have undertaken versions of cascade
prediction despite these difﬁculties [19, 23, 26, 29], but to some
extent they are inherent in these problem formulations.
These challenges reinforce the fact that ﬁnding a robust way to
formulate the problem of cascade prediction remains an open problem. And because it is open, we are missing a way to obtain a
deeper, more fundamental understanding of the predictability of
cascades. How should we set up the question so that it becomes
possible to address these issues directly, and engage more deeply
with arguments about whether cascades might, in the end, be inherently unpredictable?
The present work: Cascade growth prediction. In this paper,
we propose a new approach to the prediction of cascades, and show
that it leads to strong and robust prediction results. We are motivated by a view of cascades as complex dynamic objects that pass
through successive stages as they grow. Rather than thinking of
a cascade as something whose ﬁnal endpoint should be predicted
from its initial conditions, we think of it as something that should be
tracked over time, via a sequence of prediction problems in which
we are constantly seeking to estimate the cascade’s next stage from
its current one.
What would it mean to predict the “next stage” of a cascade? If
we think about all cascades that reach size k, there is a distribution
of eventual sizes that these cascades will reach. Then the distribution of cascade sizes has a median value f (k) ≥ k. This number
f (k) is thus the “typical” ﬁnal size for cascades that reached size

at least k. Hence, the most basic way to ask about a cascade’s next
stage of growth, given that it currently has size k, is to ask whether
it reaches size f (k).
We therefore propose the following cascade growth prediction
problem: given a cascade that currently has size k, predict whether
it grow beyond the median size f (k). (As we show later, the prediction problem is equivalent to asking: given a cascade of size k,
will the cascade double its size and reach at least 2k nodes?) This
implicitly deﬁnes a family of prediction problems, one for each k.
We can thus ask how cascade predictability behaves as we sweep
over larger and larger values of k. (There are natural variants and
generalizations in which we ask about reaching target sizes other
than the median f (k).) This problem formulation has a number
of strong advantages over standard ways of trying to deﬁne cascade prediction. First, it leads to a prediction problem in which the
classes are balanced, rather than highly unbalanced. Second, it allows us to ask for the ﬁrst time how the predictability of a cascade
varies over the range of its growth from small to large. Finally, it
more closely approximates the real tasks that need to be solved in
applications for managing viral content, where many evolving cascades are being monitored, and the question is which are likely to
grow signiﬁcantly as time moves forward.
For studying cascade growth prediction, it is important to work
with a system in which the sharing and resharing of information
is widespread, the complete trajectories of many cascades—both
large and small—are observable, and the same piece of content
shared separately by many people, so that we can begin to control for variation in content. For this purpose, we use a month of
complete photo-resharing data from Facebook, which provides a
rich ecosystem of shared content exhibiting all of these properties.
In this setting, we focus on several categories of questions:
(i) How high an accuracy can we achieve for cascade growth
prediction? If we cannot improve on baseline guessing, then
this would be evidence for the inherent unpredictably of cascades. But if we can signiﬁcantly improve on this baseline,
then there is a basis for non-trivial prediction. In the latter
case, it also becomes important to understand the features
that make prediction possible.
(ii) Is growth prediction more tractable on small cascades or large
ones? In other words, does the future behavior of a cascade
become more or less predictable as the cascade unfolds?
(iii) Beyond just the growth of a cascade, can we predict its “shape”
— that is, its network structure?
Summary of results. Given the challenges in predicting cascades,
we ﬁnd surprisingly strong performance for the growth prediction
problem. Moreover, the performance is robust in the sense that
multiple distinct classes of features, including those based on time,
graph structure, and properties of the individuals resharing, can
achieve accuracies well above the baseline. Cascades whose initial reshares come quickly are more likely to grow signiﬁcantly;
and from a structural point of view, breadth rather than depth in the
resharing tree is a better predictor of signiﬁcant growth.
We investigate the performance of growth prediction as a function of the size of the cascade so far — when we want to predict
the growth of a cascade of size k, how does our accuracy depend
on k? It is not a priori clear whether accuracy should increase or
decrease as a function of k, since for any value of k the challenge
is to determine what the cascade will do in the future. Seeing more
of the cascade (larger k) does not make the problem easier, as it
also involves predicting “farther” into the future (i.e., whether the
cascade will reach size at least 2k). We ﬁnd that accuracy increases

with k, so that it is possible to achieve better performance on large
cascades than small ones. The features that are most signiﬁcant for
prediction change with k as well, with properties of the content and
the original author becoming less important, and temporal features
remaining relatively stable.
We also consider a related question: how much of a cascade do
we need to see in order to obtain good performance? Speciﬁcally,
suppose we want to predict the growth of a cascade of size at least
R, but we are only able to see the ﬁrst k < R nodes in the cascade.
How does prediction performance depend on k, and in particular, is
there a “sweet spot” where a relatively small value of k gives most
of the performance beneﬁts? We ﬁnd in fact that there is no sweet
spot: performance essentially climbs linearly in k, all the way up to
k = R. Perhaps surprisingly, more information about the cascade
continues to be useful even up to the full snapshot of size R.
In addition to growth, we also study how well we can predict
the eventual “shape” of the cascade, using metrics for evaluating
tree structures as a numerical measure of the shape. We obtain
performance signiﬁcantly above baseline for this task as well; and
perhaps surprisingly, multiple classes of features including temporal ones perform well for this task, despite the fact that the quantity
being predicted is a purely structural one.
One of the compelling arguments that originally brought the issue of inherent unpredictability onto the research agenda was a
striking experiment by Salganik, Dodds, and Watts, in which they
showed that the same piece of content could achieve very different
levels of popularity in separate independent settings [28]. Given
the richness of our data, we can study a version of this issue here
in which we can control for the content being shared by analyzing
many cascades all arising from the sharing of the same photo. As
in the experiment of Salganik et al., we ﬁnd that independent resharings of the same photo can generate cascades of very different
sizes. But we also show that this observation can be compatible
with prediction: after observing small initial portions of these distinct cascades for the same photo, we are able to predict with strong
performance which of the cascades will end up being the largest. In
other words, our data shows wide variation in cascades for the same
content, but also predictability despite this variation.
Overall, our goal is to set up a framework in which prediction
questions for cascades can be carefully analyzed, and our results
indicate that there is in fact a rich set of questions here, pointing to
important distinctions between different types of features characterizing cascades, and between the essential properties of large and
small cascades.

RELATED WORK

Many papers have analyzed and cataloged properties of empirically observed information cascades, while others have considered
theoretical models of cascade formation in networks. Most relevant
to our work are those which focus on predicting the future popularity of a given piece of content. These studies have proposed rich
sets of features for prediction, which we discuss later in Section 3.2.
Much prior work aims to predict the volume of aggregate activity
— the total number of up-votes on Digg stories [29], total hourly
volume of news phrases [34], or total daily hashtag use [23]. At the
other end of the spectrum, research has focused on individual userlevel prediction tasks: whether a user will retweet a speciﬁc tweet
[26] or share a speciﬁc URL [10]. Rather than attempt to predict
aggregate popularity or individual behavior in the next time step,
we instead look at whether an information cascade grows over the
median size (or doubles in size, as we later show).
Research on communities deﬁned by user interests [3] or hashtag content [27] has also looked at a notion of growth, predicting

whether a group will increase in size by a given amount. Nevertheless, these focused on groups of already non-trivial size, and their
growth predicted without an explicit internal cascade topology, and
without tracking predictability over different size classes.
Several papers focus on predictions after having observed a cascade for a given ﬁxed time frame [19, 23, 30]. In contrast, rather
than studying speciﬁc time slices, we continuously observe the cascade over its entire lifetime and attempt to understand how predictive performance varies as the cascade develops. Moreover, our
methodology does not penalize slowly but persistently growing cascades. Thus, we predict the size and the structure after having observed a certain number of initial reshares.
Many studies consider the cascade prediction task as a regression problem [6, 19, 29, 30] or a binary classiﬁcation problem with
large bucket sizes [16, 17, 19]. The danger with these approaches
is that they are biased towards studying extremely large but also extremely rare cascades, bypassing the whole issue about the general
predictability of cascades. For example, research has speciﬁcally
focused on content and users that create extremely large cascades,
such as popular hashtags [15, 33] and very popular users [9, 14],
which has led to criticism that cascades may only be predictable
after they have already grown large [31]. While it is useful to understand the dynamics of extremely popular content, such content
is also very rare. Thus, we rather seek to understand predictability
along cascade’s entire lifetime. We consider cascades that have as
few as ﬁve reshares, and introduce a classiﬁcation task which is not
skewed towards very large cascades.

PREDICTING CASCADE GROWTH

To examine the cascade growth prediction problem, we ﬁrst deﬁne and motivate our experimental setup and the feature sets used,
then report our prediction results with respect to different k.

3.1

Experimental setup

Mechanics of information passing on Facebook. We focus on
content consisting of posts the author has designated as public,
meaning that anyone on Facebook is eligible to view it, and we
further restrict our attention to content in the form of photos, which
comprise the majority of reshare cascades on Facebook [9]. Such
posts are then distributed by Facebook’s News Feed, typically at
ﬁrst to users who are either friends of the poster or who subscribe
to their content, e.g. as followers. Each post is accompanied by a
“share” link that allows friends and followers to “reshare” the post
with her own friends and followers, thus expanding the set of users
exposed to the content. This explicit sharing mechanism creates information cascades, starting with the root node (user or page) that
originally created the content, and consisting of all subsequent reshares of that content.
Figure 1 illustrates the process with an example: a node v0 posts
a public photo, seen by v0 ’s friends and followers in their News
Feeds. Friends v1 and v3 then share the photo with their own
friends. This way the photo propagates over the edges of the Facebook network and creates an information cascade. We represent the
ˆ
cascade graph as G, and the induced subgraph of all photo sharers, including all friendship or follow links between them as G .
Notice that some users (ex. v5 ) are exposed via multiple sources
(v0 , v1 , v3 , v4 ).
An important issue for our understanding of reshare cascades
is the following distinction: content can be produced by users —
individual Facebook accounts whose primary audience consists of
friends and any subscribers the individual has — and it can also be
produced by pages, which correspond to the Facebook accounts of

Figure 1: An information cascade represented by solid edges on a

graph G, starting at v0 (G). Dashed lines indicate friendship edges;
the edges between resharers make up the friend subgraph G .

companies, brands, celebrities, and other highly visible public entities. In the common parlance around cascades, reshared content
originally produced by a user is often informally viewed as more
“organic,” developing a following in a more bottom-up way. In
contrast, reshared content from pages is seen as more top-down,
and generally broadcast via News Feed to a larger set of initial
followers. A natural question, and a theme that will run through
several analyses in the paper, is to understand if these distinctions
carry over to the properties we study here: do user-initiated cascades differ in their predictability and their underlying structure
from page-initiated cascades?
Dataset description. We sampled our anonymized dataset from
photos uploaded to Facebook in June 2013 and observed any reshares occurring within 28 days of initial upload. The dataset only
includes photos posted publicly (viewable by anyone), and not deleted
during the observation period. Further, we exclude photos with
fewer than ﬁve reshares as is required by the prediction tasks described below. We constructed diffusion trees ﬁrst by taking the explicit cascade, e.g. C clicking “share" on B’s “share" of A’s photo
forms the cascade A → B → C . However, it is possible that
user C clicked on user B’s share, and then directly reshared from
A. Since we want to know how the information actually ﬂowed in
the network, we reconstruct the path A → B → C based on click,
impression, and friend/follower data [9].
Figure 2 begins to show how photos uploaded by pages generate
cascades that differ from those uploaded by users. In our dataset,
81% of cascades are initiated by pages. Figure 2 shows the cascade size distribution for pages, users, and the two combined. Page
cascades are typically larger than user cascades, e.g., 11% of page
cascades reach at least 100 reshares, while only 2% of user cascades do, though both follow heavy tailed distributions. Fitting
power-law curves to their tails, we observe power-law exponents
of α equal to 2.2, 2.1, and 2.1 for user, page, and both, respectively
(xmin = 10, 2000, 2000).
In addition to cascade growth, we quantify the shape of a cascade
using the Wiener index, deﬁned as the average distance between all

pairs of nodes in a cascade. Recent work has proposed the Wiener
index as a measure of the structural virality of a cascade [2]. Figure 3 shows examples of cascades with varying Wiener index values. Intuitively, a cascade with low structural virality has most
of its distribution following from a small number of hub nodes,
while a cascade with high virality will have many long paths. Figure 2 shows the distribution of cascade virality (as measured by
Wiener index) in our dataset, which, as we saw with cascade size,
follows a heavy-tailed distribution. While user cascades are typically smaller than page cascades in our dataset, they tend to have
greater structural virality, supporting the intuition that the structure
of user-initiated cascades is richer and deeper than that of pageinitiated cascades.
Deﬁning the cascade growth prediction problem. Our aim in
this paper is to study how well cascades can be predicted. Moreover, we are interested in understanding how various aspects of the
prediction task affect the predictive performance.
There are several formulations of the task. If we were to deﬁne
the task as a regression problem, predictions may be skewed towards large cascades, as cascade size follows a heavy-tailed distribution (Figure 2(right)). Similarly, if we deﬁne it as a classiﬁcation
problem of predicting whether a cascade reaches a speciﬁc size, we
may end up with unbalanced classes, and an overrepresentation of
large cascades. Also, if we simply observed a small initial portion
of a cascade, and predict its future size, the problem is pathological
as almost all cascades are small. And, if we only varied the initial period of observation, the task of predicting whether a cascade
reaches a certain size gets easier as we observe more of it.
To remedy these issues, we deﬁne a classiﬁcation task that does
not suffer from these deﬁciencies. We consider a binary classiﬁcation problem where we observe the ﬁrst k reshares of a cascade and
predict whether the eventual size of a cascade reaches the median
size of all the cascades with at least k reshares, f (k). This allows
us to study how cascade predictibility varies with k. As exactly
half the cascades reach a size greater than the median by deﬁnition,
random guessing achieves accuracy of 50%.
Interestingly, the question of whether the cascade will reach f (k)
is equivalent to that of whether a cascade will double in size. This
follows directly from the fact that cascade size distribution follows
a power-law with exponent α ≈ 2. Consider a power-law distribution on the interval (xmin , ∞) with a power-law exponent α ≈ 2.
Then the median f (x) of this distribution is 2 · xmin , as demonstrated by the following calculation:
f (x)
xmin

α−1

dx =

⇒ f (x) = 2 α−1 xmin = 2xmin
2

As we examine cascades of size greater than k = xmin , the
median size of these cascades is thus 2 · k from this derivation. In
each of our prediction tasks, we observe that this is indeed true.
Methods used for learning. Our general methodology for the cascade prediction problem will be to represent a cascade by a set of

features and then use machine learning classiﬁers to predict its future size. We used a variety of learning methods, including linear
regression, naive Bayes, SVM, decision trees and random forests.
However, we primarily report performance of the logistic regression classiﬁer for ease of comparison. In many cases, the performance of most classiﬁers was similar, although non-linear classiﬁers such as random forests usually performed slightly better than
linear classiﬁers such as logistic regression. In all cases, we performed 10-fold cross validation and report the classiﬁcation accuracy, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC).

3.2

Factors driving cascade growth

We proceed by describing factors that contribute to the growth
and spreading of cascades. We group these factors into ﬁve classes:
properties of the content that is spreading, features of the original
poster, features of the resharer, structural features of the cascade,
and temporal characteristics of the cascade. Table 1 contains a detailed list of features.
Content features. The ﬁrst natural factor contributing to the ability of the cascade to spread is the content itself [7]. On Twitter,
tweet content and in particular, hashtags, are used to generate content features [23, 30], and identify topics affecting retweet likelihood [26]. LDA topic models have also been incorporated into
these prediction tasks [16], and human raters employed to infer the
interestingness of content [5, 26]. In our work, we relied on a linear SVM model, trained using image GIST descriptors and color
histogram features, to assign likelihood scores of a photo being
a closeup shot, taken indoors or outdoors, synthetically generated
(e.g., screenshots or pure text vs. photographs), or contained food,
a landmark, person, nature, water, or overlaid text (e.g., a meme).
We also analyzed words in the caption accompanying an image for
positive sentiment, negative sentiment, and sociality [17, 25].
Nevertheless, while content features affected the performance of
structural and temporal features, we ﬁnd that they are weak predictors of how widely disseminated a piece of content would become.
Original poster/resharer features. Some prior work focused on
features of the root note in a cascade to predicting the cascade’s
evolution, ﬁnding that content from highly-connected individuals
reaches larger audiences, and thus spreads further. Users with large
follower counts on Twitter generated the largest retweet cascades [5].
Separately, features of an author of a tweet were shown to be more
important than features of the tweet itself [26]. In many Twitter
studies predicting cascade size or popularity, a user’s number of
followers ranks among the top, if not the most, important predictor
of popularity [5, 23].
Other features of the root node have also been studied, such as
the number of prior retweets of a user’s posts [5, 16], and how
many Twitter lists a user was included in [26]. The number of @mentions of a Twitter user was used to predict whether, and how
soon a tweet would be retweeted, how many users would directly
retweet, and the depth a cascade would reach [33]. Still, [8] found
that various measures of a user’s popularity are not very correlated
with his or her inﬂuence.
We capture the intuition behind these factors by deﬁning demographic as well as network features of the original poster as well
as the features of the users who reshared the content so far. We
use Facebook’s distinction of users (individuals) and pages (entities representing an interest) to further distinguish different origin
types, in addition to the inﬂuence features mentioned above.
Structural features of the cascade. Networks provide the substrate through which information spreads, and thus their structure
inﬂuences the path and reach of the cascade. As illustrated in Fig-

ure 1, we generate features from both the graph of the ﬁrst k reˆ
shares (G), as well as the induced friend subgraph of the ﬁrst k
ˆ
resharers (G ). Whereas the reshare graph G describes the actual
spread of a cascade, the friend subgraph G provides information
about the social ties between these initial resharers. The social
graph G allows us to compute the potential reach of these reshares.
Previous work considered the network structure of the underlying graph in inferring the virality of content [32], with highly viral
items spreading across communities. We use the density of the initial reshare cascade (subgraph k ) and the proximity to the root node
(orig _connections k , did _leave ) as proxies for whether an item
is spreading primarily within a community or across many. One
can also look outside the network between resharers, and count the
number of users reachable via all friendship and follow edges of the
ﬁrst k users (border _nodes k ). This relates to total number of exposed users, and has been demonstrated to be an important feature
in predicting Twitter hashtag popularity [23].
As we can trace information ﬂow on Facebook exactly, we need
not worry about independent entry points inﬂuencing a cascade [6,
24]; external inﬂuence instead allows us to investigate multiple independent cascades arising from the same content (see Section 5.1).
Temporal features. Properties related to the “speed” of the cascade (e.g., time k ) were shown to be the most important features in
predicting thread length on Facebook [4], and are a primary mechanism in predicting online content popularity [29]. Moreover, as
the speed of diffusion changes over time, this may have a strong
effect on the ability of the cascade to continue spreading through
the network [33].
We characterize a number of temporal properties of cascade diffusion (see Table 1). In particular, we measure the change in the
speed of reshares (time 1..k ), compare the differences between the
speed in the ﬁrst and second half of the measurement period (time 1..k/2 ,
time k/2..k ), and qunatify the number of users who were exposed
to the cascade per time unit (views 1..k−1, k ).

3.3

Predicting cascade growth

To illustrate the general performance of the features described in
the previous section we consider a simple prediction task, where
we observe the ﬁrst 5 reshares of the cascade and want to predict whether it will reach the median cascade size (or equivalently,
whether it will double and be reshared at least 10 times). For the
experiment we use a set of Nc = 150,572 photos, where each photo
was shared at least 5 times. The total number of reshares of these
photos was Nr = 9,233,300.

Figure 5: If we observe the ﬁrst k reshares of a cascade, and want
to predict whether the cascade will double in size, our prediction
improves as we observe more of it.
Figure 4 shows logistic regression performance using all features
from Table 1. For this task, random guessing would obtain a performance of 0.5, while our method achieves surprisingly strong performance: classiﬁcation accuracy of 0.795 and AUC of 0.877. If
we relax the task and instead of predicting above vs. below median
size, we predict top vs. bottom quartile (top 25% vs. bottom 25%)
the accuracy rises even further to 0.926, and the AUC to 0.976.
Overall, while each feature set is individually signiﬁcantly better than predicting at random, it is the set of temporal features
that outperforms all other individual feature sets, obtaining performance scores within 0.025 of those obtained when using all features. To understand if we could do well without temporal features,
we trained a classiﬁer which excluded them and were still able to
obtain reasonable performance even without these features. This is
especially useful when one knows through whom information was
passed, but not when it was passed. The lack of reliance on any individual set of features demonstrates that the predictions are robust.
Studied individually, we also ﬁnd that temporal features generally performed best, followed by structural features. The reshare
rate in the second half (time k/2..k ) was most predictive, attaining
accuracy of 0.73. This was followed by the rate of user views of the
original photo, views 0,k , and the time elapsed between the original post and ﬁfth reshare, time 5 (both 0.72). In fact, time k+1 is
always more accurate than time k . The most accurate structural
features were did _leave and outdeg (v0 ) (both 0.65). We examine
individual feature importance in more detail later.

3.4

Predictability and the observation window
of size k

It is also natural to ask whether cascades get more or less predictable as we observe more of the initial growth of a cascade.
One may think that observing more of the cascade may allow us
to extrapolate its future growth better; on the other hand, additional
observed reshares may also introduce noise and uncertainty in the
future growth of the cascade. Note that the task does not get easier
as we observe more of the cascade, as we are predicting whether
the cascade will reach size 2k (or equivalently, the median) given
that we have seen k reshares so far.
Figure 5 shows that the predictive performance of whether a cascade doubles in size increases as a function of the number of observed reshares k. In other words, it is easier to predict whether a
cascade that has reached 25 reshares will get another 25, than to
predict whether a cascade that has reached 5 reshares will obtain
an additional 5. Thus, the prediction accuracy for larger cascades
is above the already high accuracy for smaller values of k. The
change in the F1 score and AUC also follow a very similar trend.

Table 1: List of features used for learning. We compute these features given the cascade until the kth reshare.
Overall, these results demonstrate that observing more of the
cascade, while also predicting “farther” into the future, is easier
than observing a cascade early in its life and predicting what it will
do next (i.e., k = 5 vs. k = 25).
Fixing the minimum cascade size R. In the previous version of
the task, cascades are required only to have at least k reshares.
Thus, the set of cascades changes with k. Here, we examine a
variation of this task, where we compose a dataset of cascades that
have at least R reshares. We observe the ﬁrst k (k ≤ R) reshares of
the cascade and aim to predict whether the cascade will grow over
the median size (over all cascades of size ≥ R). As we increase

k, the task gets easier as we observe more of the cascade and the
predicted quantity does not change.
With the task, we ﬁnd that performance increases linearly with
k up to R, or that there is no “sweet spot” or region of diminishing
returns (p < 0.05 using a Harvey-Collier test). For example, the
top-most line in Figure 6 shows that when each observed cascade
has obtained 100 or more reshares, performance increases linearly
as more of the cascade is observed. This demonstrates that more
information is always better: the greater the number of observed
reshares, the better the prediction.
However, Figure 6 also shows that larger cascades are less pre-

Changes in feature importance

We now examine how feature importance changes as more and
more of the cascade is observed. In this experiment, we compute
the value of the feature after observing ﬁrst k reshares and measure the correlation coefﬁcient of the feature value with the logtransformed number of reshares (or cascade size).
Figure 7 shows the results for the ﬁve feature types. We summarize the results by the following observations:
• Correlations of averages increase with the number of observations. As we obtain more examples, naturally averages get less noisy, and more predictive (e.g., ages avg and
friends avg ).
• The original post gets less important with increasing k. After observing 100 reshares, it becomes less important that
the original post was made by a page (orig _is _page ), or
that the original poster had many connections to other users
(outdeg (v0 )).
• Similarly, the actual content being reshared gets less important with increasing k. Almost all content features tend to
zero as k increases, except for has _caption and is _en . This
can be explained by the fact that cascades of photos with
captions have a unimodal distribution, and cascades started
by English speakers have a bimodal distribution. Thus, these
features become correlated in opposite directions.
• Successful cascades get many views in a short amount of
time, and achieve high conversion rates. The number of
users who have viewed reshares of a cascade is more negatively correlated with increasing k (views 1..k−1,k ), suggesting that requiring “fewer tries” to achieve a given number of
reshares is a positive indicator of its future success. On the
other hand, while requiring fewer views is good, rapid exposure, or reaching many users within a short amount of time
is also a positive predictor (views 1..k−1,k ).
• Structural connectedness is important, but gets less important over time. Nevertheless, reshare depth remains highly

dictable than smaller cascades. For example, predicting whether
cascades with 1,000 to 2,000 reshares grow large is signiﬁcantly
more difﬁcult than predicting cascades of 100 to 200 reshares. This
shows that once one knows that a cascade will grow to be large,
knowing the characteristics of the very beginning of its spread is
less useful for prediction.

be long-lasting, as even users “far away” from the original
poster still ﬁnd the content interesting.
• The importance of timing features remains relatively stable.
While highly correlated, timing features remain remarkably
stable in importance as k increases.

better than chance, with accuracy between 0.49 and 0.52.

PREDICTING CASCADE STRUCTURE

Similar to predicting cascade size we can also attempt to predict
the structure of the cascade. We now turn to examining how structural features of the cascade determine its evolution and spread.

4.1

User-started and page-started cascades

Earlier we discussed the notion of structural virality as a measure of how much the structure of a cascade is dominated by a
few hub nodes, and we saw that user-initiated cascades have signiﬁcantly higher structural virality than page-initiated cascades, reﬂecting their richer graph structure. It is natural to ask how these
distinctions vary with the size of the cascade — are large userinitiated cascades more similar to page-initiated ones, e.g. are they
driven by popular hub nodes?
Figure 8 shows that the opposite is the case — user and pageinitiated cascades remain structurally distinct, with this distinction
even increasing with cascade size. Moreover, this difference continues to hold even when controlling for the number of ﬁrst-degree
reshares (directly from the root), suggesting a certain robustness to
their richer structure. Because of these structural differences, we
handle user and page cascades separately in the analyses that follow.
These distinctions may also help explain a large difference in
the predictability of user-initiated vs. page-initiated cascades. We
observe that for page cascades accuracy exceeds 80%, while that
for user cascades is slightly under 70%. (These results also hold
for the F1 score and AUC, with a difference of about 0.1.) The
fact that much more of the structure of a page-initiated cascade is
typically carried by a small number of hub nodes may suggest why
the prediction task is more tractable in this case.

4.2

The initial structure of a cascade inﬂuences
its eventual size

To understand how structure bears on the future growth of the
cascade, we examine how the conﬁguration of the ﬁrst three reshares (and the root) correlates with the cascade size. In particular, we measure the proportion of cascades starting from each conﬁguration that reach the median size. We do this separately for
two different initial poster types: a user, and a page. We discard
“celebrity” users who may large followings like the most popular
pages. Figure 9a shows that as the initial cascade structure becomes
shallower, the proportion of cascades that double in size increases.

Figure 9: Shallow initial cascade structures are indicative of larger
cascades. In contrast to page-started cascades, where the mean time
to the 3rd reshare decreases with decreasing depth of the initial
cascade, shallow cascades take a much longer time to form for userstarted cascades. For these, the connections of the 1st resharer also
signiﬁcantly impacts the time to the 3rd resharer, especially when
it receives two reshares before the original receives a second.
To examine why this would be the case, we also examined the time
needed for the 3rd reshare to happen (Figure 9c). For pages, shallower cascades tend to happen more rapidly, consistent with being
initiated by a popular page and achieving a large number of reshares directly from its fans. Interestingly, the conﬁguration having the second and third reshares stemming from the ﬁrst reshare
correspond to having a ﬁrst resharer with many connections, and
indicating that the initial poster is less popular, be it a page or user
(Figure 9d).
Curiously, for user-started cascades, the star conﬁguration tends
to grow into the largest cascades, but is also the slowest. It also
tends to correspond to the ﬁrst resharer having a low degree, both
for page and user roots. One might speculate that this pattern is
indicative of the item’s appeal to less well-connected users, who
also happen to be more likely to reshare. In fact, a median resharer
has 35 fewer friends than someone who is active on the site nearly
every day. Thus, an item’s appeal, rather than the initial network
structure, may drive the eventual cascade size in the long run.

4.3

Predicting cascade structure

The observations above naturally lead to the question of whether
it is possible to predict future cascade structure. In particular, we
aim to distinguish cascades that spread like a virus in a shallow
forest ﬁre-like pattern (Figure 3a) and cascades which spread in
long, narrow string-like pattern (Figure 3c). As discussed earlier,
this difference is related to the structural virality of a cascade and is
quantiﬁed by the Wiener index. Here, we observe k = 5 reshares
of a cascade and aim to predict whether the ﬁnal cascade will have
a Wiener index above or below the median. We obtain accuracy of
0.725 (F1 = 0.715, AUC = 0.796), while random guessing would,
by construction, achieve accuracy of 0.5.
Temporal and structural features are most predictive of structure. For this task we expect structural features to be most important, while we expect temporal features not to be indicative

of the cascade structure. However, when we train the model on
individual classes of features we surprisingly ﬁnd that both temporal and structural features are almost equally useful in predicting cascade structure: 0.622 vs. 0.620. Nevertheless, structural
features remain individually more accurate (≈ 0.58) and highly
correlated (0.161 ≤ |r| ≤ 0.255) with the Wiener index. Individually, one temporal feature, views 1..k−1,k , is slightly more
accurate (0.602) compared to the best-performing structural feature, outdeg (ˆ0 ) (0.600), but is signiﬁcantly less correlated (0.041
v
vs. −0.255). The two classes of features nicely complement each
other, since when combined, accuracy increases to 0.72.
Cascade structure also becomes more predictable with increasing k. Like for cascade growth prediction, our prediction performance improves as we observe more of the cascade, with accuracy
linearly increasing from 0.724 when k is 5 to 0.808 when k is 100.
A linear relation also exists in the alternate task where we set the
minimum cascade size R to be 100, varying k between 5 and 100.
Changes in feature importance. As we increase k, we ﬁnd that
the structural features become highly correlated with the Wiener
index, suggesting that the initial shape of a cascade is a good indicator of its ﬁnal structure. Rapidly growing cascades also result in
ﬁnal structures that are shallower—temporal features become more
strongly correlated with the Wiener index as k increases. Unlike
with cascade size, views were generally weakly correlated with
structure, while content features had a weak, near-constant effect.
Nonetheless, some of these features still provided reasonable performance in the prediction task.
User vs. page-started cascades. In predicting the shape of a cascade, we ﬁnd that our overall prediction accuracy for pages is slightly
higher (0.724) than for users (0.700). While using only structural
features alone results in a higher prediction accuracy for users (0.643)
than for pages (0.601), user and content features are signiﬁcantly
more predictive of cascade structure in the case of pages.
To sum up, we ﬁnd that predicting the shape of a cascade is not
as hard as one might fear. Nevertheless, predicting cascade size is
still much easier than predicting cascade shape, though classiﬁers
for either achieve non-trivial performance.

Figure 11: The initial exposure of the uploaded photo and initial
reshares serve to differentiate datasets from one another, as can be

and lines through each circle indicate the 95% conﬁdence interval.
tural features may still capture some of the difference in content.
Thus, we now study how well we can predict cascade size if we
control for the content of the photo itself. We consider identical
photos uploaded to Facebook by different users and pages, which
is not a rare occurrence. We used an image matching algorithm
to identify copies of the same image and place their corresponding
cascades into clusters (983 clusters, Nc = 38,073, Nr = 12,755,621).
As one might expect, even the same photo uploaded at different
times by different users can fare dramatically differently; a cluster
typically consists of a few or even a single cascade with a large
number of reshares, and many smaller cascades with few reshares.
The average Gini coefﬁcient, a measure of inequality, is 0.787 (σ =
0.104) within clusters. Thus, a natural task is to try to predict the
largest cascade within a cluster. For every cluster we select 10 random cascades, placing the accuracy of random guessing at 10%.
As shown in Figure 10, in all cases we signiﬁcantly outperform
the baseline. Using a random forest model, we can identify the
most popular cascade nearly half the time (accuracy 0.497); a mean
reciprocal rank of 0.662 indicates that this cascade also appears in
the top two predicted cascades almost all the time.
In terms of feature importance we notice that best results are
obtained using temporal features, followed by resharer, root node,
and structural features. Essentially, if one upload of the photo is initially spreading more rapidly than other uploads of the same photo,
that cascade is also likely to grow to be the largest. This points
to the importance of landing in the right part of the network at the
right time, as the same photo tends to have widely and predictably
varying outcomes when uploaded multiple times.

5.2

Feature importance in context

Some features may be more or less important for our prediction
tasks in different contexts. Figure 11 shows how several features
correlate with log-transformed cascade size when conditioned on
one of four different variables, including (1) source node type—
user vs page, (2) language—English versus Portuguese, the two
most common languages of cascade root nodes in our dataset, (3) whether
text is overlaid on a photo—a common feature of recent Internet
memes, and (4) content category. We determine content category
by matching entities in photo captions to Wikipedia articles, and

in turn articles to seven higher-level categories: animal, entertainment, politics, religion, famous people (excluding religious and political ﬁgures), food, and health.
Figure 11 shows that the initial rate of exposure of the uploaded
photo is generally more important for page cascades than for user
cascades (views 0,5 ). This is likely due to the higher variance in
the distribution of the number of followers for a user versus a page.
For page cascades in our sample, the median number of followers
is 73,855 with a standard deviation of 675,203, while for users at
the root of cascades the median number of friends and subscribers
is 1,042 with a standard deviation of 26,482. Though rate of exposure to the original photo is more important for pages, we see that
rate of exposure to the initial reshares (views 1..4,5 ) is much more
important for user cascades.
The number and rate of views also act to differentiate topical categories, with religion having the highest correlation between views
and cascade size. Correlation for the rate of views of the uploaded
photo is also higher for those with a Portuguese-speaking root node
as opposed to an English one. The feature outdeg (v0 ) indicates the
ability of the root to broadcast content, and we see this playing an
important role for page cascades, Portuguese content, photos with
text, and religious photos. This indicates that much of the success
of these cascades is related to the root nodes being directly connected to large audiences.
In addition to the analysis of Figure 11, we also examined how
the features correlate with the structural virality of the ﬁnal cascades. (Each of the reported correlation coefﬁcient comparisons
that follow are signiﬁcant at p < 10–3 using a Fisher transformation.) Photos relating to food differ signiﬁcantly from all other categories in that features of the root, such as outdeg (v0 ), are less
negatively correlated (>–0.18 vs. –0.11), and depth features, such
as depth avg , are less positively correlated (>0.18 vs. 0.11). This
k
relationship also holds for English compared to Portuguese photos. While users with many friends or followers are more likely
to generate cascades of larger size and greater structural virality,
pages with many fans create cascades of larger size, although not
necessarily greater virality (0.05 vs. –0.01). However, if the initial structure of a cascade is already deep, the ﬁnal structure of the
cascade is likely to have greater structural virality for both user and
page-started cascades (>0.16). A user-started cascade whose initial reshares are viewed more quickly is also more likely to become
viral than that for a page-started cascade (0.23 vs. 0.06).

DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION

This paper examines the problem of predicting the growth of
cascades over social networks. Although predictive tasks of similar spirit have been considered in the past, we contribute a novel
formulation of the problem which does not suffer from skew biases. Our formulation allows us to study predictability throughout
the life of a cascade. We examine not only how the predictability
changes as more and more of the cascade is observed (it improves),
but also how predictable large cascades are if we only observe them
initially (larger cascades are more difﬁcult to predict). While some
features, e.g., the average connection count of the ﬁrst k resharers,
have increasing predictive ability with increasing k, others weaken
in importance, e.g., the connectivity of the root node. We ﬁnd that
the importance of features depends on properties of the original upload as well: the topics present in the caption, the language of the
root node, as well as the content of the photo.
Despite the rich set of results we were able to obtain, there are
some limitations to this study. Most importantly, the study was conducted entirely with Facebook data and only with photos. Still, one
advantage of this is the scale of the medium; hundreds of millions

of photos are uploaded to Facebook every day, and photos, more
than other content types, tend to dominate reshares. This also gives
us high-ﬁdelity traces of how the photo moves within Facebook’s
ecosystem, which allows us to precisely overlay the spreading cascade over the social network. Moreover, we are able to identify
uploads of the same photo and track them individually. This eliminates the concern of shares being driven by an external entity and
only appearing to be spreading over the network. Instead, external drivers beneﬁt our study by creating independent ‘experiments’
where the same photo gets multiple chances to spread, helping us
control for the role of content in some of our experiments. Another disadvantage of our setup is that diffusion within Facebook is
driven by the mechanics of the site. The distinction between pages
and users is speciﬁc to Facebook, as are the mechansisms by which
users interact with content, e.g., liking and resharing. Despite these
limitations, we believe the results give general insights which will
be useful in other settings.
The present work only examines each cascade independently
from others. Future work should examine interactions between
cascades, both between different content competing for the same
attention, and between the same content surfacing at different times
and in different parts of the network. We found that when the same
photo is uploaded at least 10 times, the largest cascade was twice
as likely to be among the ﬁrst 20% of uploads than the last 20%.
Similarly, for photos uploaded 20 times, the largest cascade was
2.3 times as likely to be among the ﬁrst 20% than the last. Figure 12 shows the friendship edges between users participating in
different cascades of a single, speciﬁc photo. The high connectivity
between different cascades demonstrates that users are likely being
exposed to the same photo via different cascades, which could be a
contributing factor in why earlier uploads of the same photo tend to
generate larger cascade than later ones. Between-cascade dynamics
like this should provide ample opportunities for further research.
Addressing questions like these will lead to a richer understanding of how information spreads online and pave the way towards
better management of socially shared content and applications that
can identify trending content in its early stages.
